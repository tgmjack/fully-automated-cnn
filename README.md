# fully-automated-cnn


this system takes in 2 keywords in a list eg) ["cow", "pig" ] or ["spanners" , "hammers"]
it then searches google images for lots of images of these things. 
a convolutional neural network then learns the difference between these 2 objects


#### to do 
 a) sort out printing accuracy to choose best model  b) also see about varying image resolution    c)    better way of showing result at end
